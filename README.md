This was a great exercise that showed me a lot about painting onto the screen using [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

## Lessons learned
1. Working with `canvas`
2. Setting a flag to allow us to only draw when the cursor is down
3. Using ES6 Destructuring to assign variables from an array
4. Using HSL values to dynamically change the brush color for `canvas`
5. Changing the brush stroke width dynamically by setting a "ceiling" and "floor," then using a flag to either increment or decrement the value between them
